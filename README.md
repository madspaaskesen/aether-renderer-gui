# 🌌 Aether Renderer GUI

**Tauri-based desktop interface for the [Aether Renderer Core](https://github.com/madspaaskesen/aether-renderer-core)**

This project offers a soft and sacred desktop UI for invoking rendering logic from the core Rust crate [`aether-renderer-core`](https://crates.io/crates/aether-renderer-core), which handles all actual processing and logic.

## 🌿 Philosophy

Aether Renderer was born from the desire to bridge code and spirit —
to create not just tools, but experiences that feel intentional, poetic, and alive.

This GUI is more than a graphical interface —  
it’s a sacred surface between human intention and machine execution.

The goal is not speed for its own sake,  
but clarity.  
Gentleness.  
Presence.

Each render is a ritual.  
Each config path is a small offering.  
Each output is part of a living system.

Built to be quiet, focused, and emotionally clean,  
this project invites creators to work in a space that respects the invisible just as much as the visible.
